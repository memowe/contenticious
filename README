CONTENTICIOUS

Contenticious is a simple way to build a pretty simple website from Markdown
content. It includes a helper script which will create example pages and
directories for you to get you started in no time. With one single command
Contenticious will create static HTML ready for upload. It's also possible
to mount Contenticious in existing Mojolicious web apps.
